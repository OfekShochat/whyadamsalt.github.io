# Why the Linux Desktop is yet to be mainstream - 09/04/21

There are many different reasons as to why the Linux Desktop has not reached mainstream appeal yet. Despite (the Kernel) being around since 1991, Linux still has a miniscule market share of around 4%, and has remained here for quite a while. I want to take a look into the many different ideas as to why the Linux desktop is yet to appeal to the mainstream audience.

This post is going to share some of my opinions on the Linux Desktop and its faults, I will try to make it clear as to when I am giving my own direct opinion.

## Fragmentation

The Linux desktop as we know it today is very fragmented. This can be both a blessing and a curse for Linux users, and new-comers onto the Linux desktop. Many Linux users today love the choice that this fragmentation gives. Choices in desktop environment, window manager, init system, package manager and even distribution are all seemingly blessings to the Linux user, and it is something that I personally enjoy, however for a brand new user wanting to migrate to the Linux Desktop, this could be someone's worst nightmare.

There is no single Linux distribution (also known as a Distro) which is "The Linux", the amount of choice for new Linux users, who likely do not know a majority of the components that create a Linux distro, will likely - in my opinion - be overwhelming.

## Lack of software (and games) support

The lack of software support likely stems from the issue of fragmentation. Many application developers do not want to package their app in many different ways for each distributions package manager (which will require an application to be packaged in different ways depending on how it operates), this is one of the main reasons holding software support back on Linux, as many developers are unlikely to have the ability, or time, to maintain multiple different packages for multiple Linux distributions. This can lead to Developers not creating their software for Linux altogether, or prioritising a select few distributions (such as Ubuntu or Arch). Thankfully new (distro-agnostic) software installers, such as Snapcraft and Flatpak, are vastly reducing the fragmentation of software due to package managers, by being able to maintain your software in a single repository, such as Flatpak's Flathub repository, it greatly reduces the workload for software developers to publish their software for Linux distributions.

- Snapcraft is technically not distro-agnostic due to the fact that it requires "systemd" to run, which a majority - but not all - distributions run. 

Lack of support is only further noticeable if you are someone wanting to play computer games on a Linux distribution. From my own experience, along with other Linux (or former Linux) users, gaming on the Linux Desktop can vary drastically from working perfectly to being unusable. Many people used to be unable to play Windows games on Linux if they did not recieve a Linux port, however thanks to "Steam Proton" any steam game for Windows can be played through "Proton" a compatability layer which allows users to play Windows games that have never been ported to Linux. A website called [ProtonDB](https://protondb.com) allows users to report how games run and operate with Steam Proton. Currently 76% of the top thousand games on ProtonDB are rated as being "Bronze or lower" (Bronze being the second lowest rating), furthermore other games which are not on Steam, like Overwatch, Fortnite, World of Warcraft and many more are not playable unless you use an external launcher and scripts, and these are often times buggy and not intuitive or easy to use.

## Instability, bugs and hardware support

Linux can be reliable at the best of times, and unstable at the worst. Instability and bug issues are only more prominent if you have any hardware which drivers are not natively supported in the kernel, common examples of this can include Nvidia GPUs and their respective drivers, and Broadcom wireless drivers. This usually stems from the fact that the drivers for hardware not natively supported is typically proprietary. Many new Linux users (whom likely are unfamiliar with the command line and package managers) might want a desktop to just work, and do what it needs, without needing to search for a few hours to install the correct drivers.

Without knowing what I was doing (when I first migrated to Linux) I had managed to need to do a complete reinstall of my system, without knowing how I messed up. As I've gained more knowledge, I've only reinstalled systems as I've distro-hopped or decided to try new features on other distributions, however I still am presented with some issues that new Linux users likely would not be able to fix, some of these issues are present from install, such as APT (The package manager for Debian-based systems) telling me to insert a CD-ROM with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installed on it. Driver issues persist on practically every other distribution, with Arch Linux, in my opinion, having the worst experience, with drivers breaking after most kernel upgrades and Broadcom wireless drivers making WiFi unbearably slow for me. In my opinion new Linux users shouldn't be expected to know how to fix every bug and issue they are presented with their distribution, especially if they have only ever used Windows or MacOS in the past.

## Ease of use

In my opinion, ease of use ties directly into how mainstream an operating system becomes. This can also be seen in Linux distributions as well, with the generally "easier to use/install distributions", such as Ubuntu, Pop!_OS or Linux Mint being more widely known and downloaded compared to distributions like Arch Linux or Gentoo. Many Linux users tend to forget how daunting learning the command-line and package managers are. Installing and removing applications typically required a bit of googling to find the information. 

In my opinion Linux needs a set of GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications which are able to handle tasks where the command-line currently dominates. These applications should be included in every distribution, and should be the same across all distributions for ease-of-use. Some of these applications would be;
- A software store which has an intuitive design, quick installations and great search functionality for applications.
- A standardised application to handle searching, installing and enabling/disabling of drivers.
- A simple application which will allow users to report bugs and issues to the distribution developers.

## Community

Much like [TheEvilSkeleton](https://theevilskeleton.frama.io/2021/04/06/why-the-linux-desktop-has-not-yet-been-adopted-by-the-masses.html) said in their blog post, one of the reasons the Linux Desktop has not yet been mass-adopted is due to the community. The community can be both great and horrendous. The Linux Community is one of the most helpful I have seen, with Discord servers, forums and other chat services dedicated to discussion and aiding the community. Despite this the Linux community is also very much toxic and conservative. Wars between users are very likely, people arguing over what desktop environment, window manager or distribution to use. To the wider audience this can seem very toxic and unappealing, and many people are probably less likely to want to join the community for it. Along with this Linux users typically have a conservative mindset on software. "If it works, why replace it" is a very common argument seen when discussing X11 and Wayland, two windowing systems. Wayland was created originally to replace X11, since it is lacking in many areas, however many Linux users are quick to critisise it saying that "X11 already works, why use something new". This conservative mindset only keeps innovation on the Linux desktop held back, rather than boosting it forwards.

## Conclusion

In my opinion, there are many different reasons as to why the Linux desktop is yet to reach mainstream appeal. Conservativism, toxicity, hard-to-use,  instability and fragmentation all combine to hold the Linux desktop back, overall the Linux desktop - in my opinion - will never be able to reach mainstream appeal until all of these critical issues are fixed on the desktop in one way or another. These issues have either not existed on Windows/MacOS or have been fixed. This is why, in 2021, the Linux desktop is still trying to catch-up to its rivals.
