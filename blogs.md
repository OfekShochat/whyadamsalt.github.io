# My Blogs and writeups

This page is a collection of my blogs and writeups that I have created! They will more than likely be talking about Linux, technology, open-source software or coding in general. I spend a lot of time researching and asking questions to create these writeups to provide the most factual information, however my writeups will more than likely be used to also convey my own opinion.
