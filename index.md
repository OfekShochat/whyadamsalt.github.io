# Welcome to my personal website!

Here I will likely talk about myself, anything relating to Free, Open Source, Software (FOSS), GNU/Linux and anything relating to software, including software I create myself! You can look through my [Blogs here](blogs.md)!

I am currently the Lead of Cob:web Development. I am currently working on two projects: 
- CelOS, an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution with Flatpak at its core. 
- Whittr, a fully encrypted, beautiful chatting application that works in your browser with no sign-up!

I also oversee and manage the rest of the projects in Cob:web Development, such as;
- CSSheet, a simple, CSS framework which allows anyone to create a beautiful website easily!
- Minimal, A multi-purpose Discord bot coded in Discord.py

and finally, I also manage the Cob:web website along with this blog!
